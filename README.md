# JayGames_Spring_MVC
This version of the JayGames website will be built on the Spring MVC framework. The core purpose of the website is to allow users to sign
up, download games, and discuss their experiences on a forum. This project utilizes a Tomcat 9 server and MySQL database featured in 
XAMPP.

As a side project, after having completed an interesting tutorial with Java's Remote Method Invocation library, I saw a quick and 
convenient way to handle networking that User's might be able to enjoy. For now, I am going to work on completing the RMIMessenger, an 
Instant Messaging prototype system that let's users who know about port forwarding or hamachi, host a private group chat that their 
friends can connect to if they know the host's ip.

EDIT: Completed integration of messenger and Plot Four game.

I can put in client code in the game to store the ip address and port behind the scenes so that the typical player does not see this information and provide some privacy for the host. 

General Project TODO: 
- Add in lobby browser to game client.
- Get OpenSSL integrated with Java RMI socket factory for more secure network.
- Put the forum together. Considering MongoDB because Yumei says it works better than MySQL.
- Back to fleshing out website learning Angular.js, more HTML, and CSS.
- Make more games to download and play.
