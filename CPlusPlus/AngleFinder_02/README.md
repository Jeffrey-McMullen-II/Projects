This program will give you up to two angles of fire required to hit a target. It took me a while to figure out which formula
would get the job done but I ended up finding it on wikipedia. The link to the formula is in the cpp script. The program
prompts the user for the firing speed of the projectile, the distance to the target, the target's height off the ground,
and your height off the ground. With this information, it will determine if you can hit the target, and in that case,
the two different angles you can use to fire the projectile and hit the target.
