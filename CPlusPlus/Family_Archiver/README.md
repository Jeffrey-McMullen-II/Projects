This program allows the user to enter family member information into a file. When the program starts up, it will load that family
information so that the user can pick up where they left off. At the time that I wrote this, I found a library called Boost which
helped making serialization of classes more easy. Each family and its members get stored into its own class. The classes are
written to the file when the user makes changes to the information.
