# JayGames_JSF
	This website instance uses managed beans to maintain the user's credentials throughout the session
	In this website version I practiced a bit with prepared statements for user creation and login.

# JayGames_Spring_MVC
	This website instance has session scoping through Springs convenient annotations. 
	This version of the website doesn't use the database for login, but it does have a download controller so that the end user can get the Plot Four game.

# x10JAYWebApplication
	This website instance is a very raw prototype of the website where the website is simulated with javafx. This required a connection factory to send the login credentials to the login.php script as an http post.
