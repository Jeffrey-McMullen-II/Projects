When running the program, you can press from numbers One through Six to indicate to the ai which station it is meant to travel to.
Also, to change the nametag that the ai has next to it, press the 0 button to bring up a couple of inputboxes, you can press 0 again while a textbox is not active to hide the inputboxes.
Type the name displayed next to the ai in the first box, then type the name you want it to be in the second box, then press enter.
